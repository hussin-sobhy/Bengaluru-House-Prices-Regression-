## Project Overview
This project, **"Bengaluru House Prices,"** focuses on developing a real estate price prediction website using Python, Sklearn, and Flask. The main goal of the project is to build a linear regression model to predict house prices in Bengaluru using a dataset from Kaggle. The project also involves data cleaning, outlier detection, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model optimization.

## Project Objectives
- **Build a Linear Regression Model:** Develop a model using Sklearn to predict real estate prices in Bengaluru.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and performing feature engineering.
- **Model Optimization:** Use techniques such as GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation to optimize the model's performance.
- **Deploy with Flask:** Create a Python Flask server to serve the model and handle HTTP requests for price predictions.
