1- read the data from csv using pandas

2- drop ['area_type', 'balcony', 'society', 'availability'] columns 

               ("Try to decoded area type at the end and see the result") "after Try this it doesn't matter"

3- drop all nulls (total 90 rows)

4- clean the size column by creating new column (Bhk) that has the number of bedrooms

5- clean the sqft column by take the average of the range and drop this format(34.46Sq. Meter)               

6- create new column price  per sqft

7- clean location column make any location with freq less than or equal 10 labeled as other 

8- remove any record with ('total_sqft'/ 'bhk') < 300

9- Considering that this data has a standard distribution 
I will take the first std per location and drop the other records   

                 ("Try to get 2th std or 3th at the end and see the results") "after try this the best score was in case 1th std"

10- remove bhk outlier rows based on location 
		(The remove_bhk_outliers function aims to identify and remove outliers in the price_per_sqft column of a DataFrame based on the number of bedrooms (bhk). The outliers are determined by comparing each bhk group's price_per_sqft with the statistics of the group with one less bedroom (bhk-1))

11- clean the bath column by drop the rows which (df4.bath < df4.bhk+2) has bath more than rooms plus 2 

12- drop the (size & price_per_sqft) columns

13- Get Dummies for locations 

14- split the data and run Linear Regression model

15- using GridsearchCV() and cross validation score the test these models ['Liner Regression', 'DecisionTree regressor', 'Lasso']

16- Final use Linear Regression Model to get The price Prediction according to his high score 

17- Export The model using 'Pickle' and the columns using 'Json'
